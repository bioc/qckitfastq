abstract = {FastQC aims to provide a simple way to do some quality control checks on raw sequence data coming from high throughput sequencing pipelines. It provides a modular set of analyses which you can use to give a quick impression of whether your data has any problems of which you should be aware before doing any further analysis. The main functions of FastQC are Import of data from BAM, SAM or FastQ files (any variant) Providing a quick overview to tell you in which areas there may be problems Summary graphs and tables to quickly assess your data Export of results to an HTML based permanent report Offline operation to allow automated generation of reports without running the interactive application},

abstract = {MOTIVATION Fast and accurate quality control is essential for studies involving next-generation sequencing data. Whilst numerous tools exist to quantify QC metrics, there is no common approach to flexibly integrate these across tools and large sample sets. Assessing analysis results across an entire project can be time consuming and error prone; batch effects and outlier samples can easily be missed in the early stages of analysis. RESULTS We present MultiQC, a tool to create a single report visualising output from multiple tools across many samples, enabling global trends and biases to be quickly identified. MultiQC can plot data from many common bioinformatics tools and is built to allow easy extension and customization. AVAILABILITY MultiQC is available with an GNU GPLv3 license on GitHub, the Python Package Index and Bioconda.
