\title{Generate overrepresented kmers of length k based on their
observed to expected ratio at each position across all sequences
in the dataset. The expected proportion of a length k kmer assumes
site independence and is computed as the sum of the count of each
base pair in the kmer times the probability of observing that base
pair in the data set, i.e. P(A)count_in_kmer(A)+P(C)count_in_kmer(C)+...
The observed to expected ratio is computed as log2(obs/exp). Those with
obsexp_ratio > 2 are considered to be overrepresented and appear
in the returned data frame along with their position in the sequence.}
\usage{
overrep_kmer(infile, k, output_file = NA)

\arguments{
\item{infile}{path to gzipped FASTQ file}

\item{k}{the kmer length}

\item{output_file}{File to save plot to. Default NA.}

Data frame with columns: Position (in read), Obsexp_ratio, & Kmer
